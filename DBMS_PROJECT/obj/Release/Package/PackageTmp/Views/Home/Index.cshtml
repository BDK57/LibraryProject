        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Library Management System is an application which refers to library systems which are
            generally small or medium in size. It is used by librarian to manage the library using a
            computerized system where he/she can record various transactions like issue of books, return of
            books, addition of new books, addition of new students etc.

        <h2>Book And Student</h2>
        <p>Books and student maintenance modules are also included in this system which would keep track
of the students using the library and also a detailed description about the books a library
contains. With this computerized system there will be no loss of book record or member record
which generally happens when a non computerized system is used.</p>
